Crowd Detection and Emotion Analysis Project

Overview

This project focuses on crowd detection and emotion analysis using computer vision and deep learning. It employs OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow/Keras for training a deep learning model to recognize emotions from facial images.

Features

Real-time crowd detection using OpenCV and pre-trained models.

Facial emotion recognition using deep learning.

Custom training support for emotion detection.

Expandable functionality for real-time monitoring.

Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow keras

Downloading the Dataset

For emotion analysis, you can download the FER2013 dataset from Kaggle:

Visit FER2013 Kaggle Dataset

Sign in to Kaggle and download the dataset.

Extract the dataset and place it in the dataset/ directory.

How to Run

Step 1: Run Crowd Detection

python crowd_detection.py

Step 2: Train Emotion Model (Optional)

python train_emotion_model.py

Step 3: Use Trained Model for Prediction

python emotion_recognition.py

Expansion Plans

Crowd density estimation with YOLOv8.

Automated alerts for overcrowded areas.

Integration with cloud-based AI services.
